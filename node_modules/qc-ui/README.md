# qc-ui

> A highly developed style framework based on flex[css-3]

## What's qc-ui?

> This is a personal CSS framework that does not recommend using this framework in a formal environment. The framework is only created by the author's convenience and rapid construction of the view! At the same time, the framework quotes some well-known CSS framework code:

* Integrate [fontawesome.font](http://fontawesome.com) Version - 5.0.2
* Integrate [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css) Version - 3.5.2

## Explain

1. Build a user interface quickly (you need to support CSS3, and you need to use webpack and other tools to fill in the compatibility code! ), let you focus more on the logical layer of code writing!
2. The author just write some buttons, input box style, the third more powerful animate, fontIcon are from, I think the framework of their versatility is strong enough, the framework can be used as your style configuration file (for example: base.css, reset.css), and the name of the class and the third party you can refer to the third party as like as two peas. The official document to aid in building your cool interface!
3. The author may not consume too much energy to maintain the style framework, as the framework is only used as a reset process.
